* Overview

In this directory, there are files to provide some options through xkb regarding Henkan and Muhenkan keys in Japanese keyboards.
After the installation, the following options will be available:

- jphenk:rshift
- jphenk:rctrl
- jphenk:escape
- jphenk:ralt
- jpmuhen:lshift
- jpmuhen:lctrl
- jpmuhen:escape
- jpmuhen:lalt


* Requirements

- make


* Installation

Above all, you have to build necessary files with the following command

$ make

After that, you have two options below.

1. Local install

In this way, the user do not need to make any changes on system directories.
Hence, it is often a better option, especially if you do not have sufficient permission or knowledge on the system.
For this, first of all, place this folder as $HOME/.xkb.
Then, you can edit makefile; probably, all you need is to change XKBOPTS variable.
After that, just run the following command:

$ make install

After logging out/in, you get it.

As for uninstall, type

$ make uninstall

and just delete $HOME/.xkb folder.


2. Global install

This way is potentially dangerous since it overwrites certain system files under /usr/share/X11/xkb/ directory.
First, generate patch files for evdev and evdev.lst by

$ make patch

Next, run the installation script as root:

$ sudo ./install-global.sh
( or # ./install-global.sh in no sudo systems)

The shell script copies two files jphenk and jpmuhen into the folder

/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

and applies the patches to evdev and evdev.lst in /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/.
After that, one can write these options in, for example, "/org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options" in dconf.
